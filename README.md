This web-app allows randomized selection of songs from Dance Dance Revolution and other music games
with a variety of options for filtering which songs and charts are included. After songs are picked,
they can be marked as protected or banned, or replaced with entirely separate songs. The primary use case
is in competitive tournaments, but it also works well for personal training.

The official build is available at [https://ddr.tools/](https://ddr.tools/).
After being loaded once, it supports running offline with full operation without
an internet connection in any modern web browser.

## Customizing / Contributing

This app can be easily customized for any format a tournament might use, including adding song
data for other games. If you have requests or ideas, you're welcome reach out on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QPyEATsbP7), [Facebook messenger](https://m.me/noah.manneschmidt), or [on the fediverse](https://mastodon.content.town/@noahm).

If you want to take a stab at developing features yourself, you will need have node.js >= 14.0.0 installed along with
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and some familarity with React probably helps.

Clone this repo to your computer. Then the following commands will be useful:

```sh
# Before running anything else, do this!
# It's a one-time local install of dependencies needed to build the app.
yarn install

# local development will start, with app running at http://localhost:8080/
# edits to the files in ./src/ will automatically reload the browser
yarn start

# if you make changes to any game/song data in ./src/songs/ this will give
# a basic sanity check on the format and contents of it
yarn validate:json

# build a zipped, standalone copy of the app that runs entirely offline,
# jacket images and all! simply unzip somewhere and open index.html
yarn build:zip
```

## Data imports

There are some other useful scripts in `scripts/` that help in maintaining data integrity and pulling
in new song data. Several have top-level aliases so you can conveniently update song data: (must have node and yarn installed, and run `yarn install` once, as above)

```sh
# download latest StepManiaX song data and jackets
yarn import:smx

# download latest DDR A3 song data and jackets (blends data from ZIv, RemyWiki, skillattack)
yarn import:ddr

# import an ITG/StepMania song pack into card draw
yarn import:itg path/to/pack/folder some-stub-name

# import the latest Pump it Up data using a data dump found here:
# https://github.com/AnyhowStep/pump-out-sqlite3-dump/
yarn import:pump path/to/pumpout/db
```

Ideas for future develoment are now being tracked as issues on this repo. Feel free to jump in if you
want to help build out something new!
